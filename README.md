# Where is My Calculator? 

## What app is this?
- A simple, elegant calculator that helps you with 6 different calculations!
- After learning about Swift and iOS for about a month, I started this small project to increase my beginner-level app development skills. 
- Although it is a very small-scale project, I learned a lot from making this app.  

## What did I learn by doing this project?
- The MVC Design Pattern (and its advantages & disadvantages : i.e Massive View Controller)
- How to use User Defaults. →      Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Basics of configuring UI elements programatically, instead of using storyboards.
- Fetching external data using REST API (i.e exchange rate data, gold price, etc)
- The importance of communication between team members.     → always be super clear on what you need to talk about, respect others, understand different professions
